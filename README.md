TinDog - A Dating App for Dogs 🐶

Project Overview

TinDog is a front-end web project designed as part of a front-end bootcamp where I learned to build responsive websites using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. This project mimics a dating app for dogs, offering a clean, modern UI and structured pricing plans. The site effectively demonstrates responsive design principles, Bootstrap grid layouts, and UI/UX best practices.
